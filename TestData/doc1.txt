·   Utilized advanced techniques (ML, AWS, GPU computing, CUDA, MATLAB) to solve and simulate a dynamic stochastic model

·   Created a labor market sub-model predicting job postings, layoffs, unemployment, and income dynamics

·   Used survey data to predict age-specific moving rates, crucial for modeling housing market dynamics
